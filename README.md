# Lane Following Robot
This is the final project for the Deep Learning class lectured by professor Chia-Han Lee in National Chiao Tung University (NCTU), Fall 2020. The objective of the final project is to build a robot to win a lane-following competition. This robot has completed the tracks with perfect scores and won first place out of 10 teams. This project used object segmentation techniques for filtering out the lane, and calculates the steering angle and moving speed of the robot. The robot speeds up on straight lanes and slows down when the curvature of the lane is greater than a certain angle.

# Method
This project adopted traditional computer vision techniques in OpenCV.
